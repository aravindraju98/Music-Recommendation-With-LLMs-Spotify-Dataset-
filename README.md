# Content-Based Music Recommendation System

## Abstract

This project implements a content-based collaborative filtering system for music recommendation using Spotify's audio feature dataset. The system leverages cosine similarity in standardized feature space to identify musically similar tracks, with an accompanying interactive interface for real-world deployment.

## Problem Statement

Traditional music recommendation systems rely heavily on collaborative filtering, which suffers from cold-start problems and requires extensive user interaction data. This project addresses these limitations by implementing a content-based approach that:

1. Operates solely on audio feature similarity
2. Provides interpretable recommendations
3. Functions immediately without user history
4. Maintains consistent performance across genres

## Methodology

### Algorithm Design

The recommendation system employs a feature-based similarity approach:

```
Input: User seed tracks T = {t‚ÇÅ, t‚ÇÇ, ..., t‚Çô}
Output: Ranked recommendation list R = {r‚ÇÅ, r‚ÇÇ, ..., r‚Çñ}

1. Feature Extraction: F(T) ‚Üí X ‚àà ‚Ñù‚ÅøÀ£·µà where d=6
2. Standardization: Z = (X - Œº) / œÉ  
3. Taste Vector: v = (1/n) Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø z·µ¢
4. Similarity Computation: sim(v, z‚±º) = cos(v, z‚±º) ‚àÄj ‚àà dataset
5. Ranking: R = top-k(sim) \ T
```

### Feature Engineering

**Selected Features**: Based on music information retrieval research, we selected 6 audio features that capture complementary aspects of musical content:

- **Danceability** (0-1): Rhythmic stability and beat strength
- **Energy** (0-1): Perceptual intensity and dynamic range  
- **Tempo** (BPM): Speed in beats per minute
- **Valence** (0-1): Musical positivity/happiness conveyed
- **Acousticness** (0-1): Confidence measure of acoustic vs. electronic
- **Loudness** (dB): Overall volume and dynamic range

**Preprocessing**: StandardScaler normalization ensures equal feature contribution:
- Zero-mean centering: xÃÑ·µ¢ = x·µ¢ - Œº·µ¢
- Unit variance scaling: z·µ¢ = xÃÑ·µ¢ / œÉ·µ¢

### Similarity Metric

**Cosine Similarity**: Chosen for orientation-based matching, robust to magnitude differences:

```
cos(u,v) = (u¬∑v) / (||u|| ||v||)
```

This metric captures musical "direction" in feature space rather than absolute values, making it suitable for preference modeling.

# Get recommendations
recommendations = rec.recommend_by_track_ids(
    example_track_ids=["track1", "track2"], 
    top_n=10
)
```

## üìà Model Performance

### Similarity Score Interpretation
- **High similarity (>0.99)**: Near-identical audio profiles
- **Good matches (0.85-0.99)**: Strong musical similarity
- **Moderate matches (0.70-0.85)**: Decent recommendations worth exploring
- **Low matches (<0.70)**: May introduce beneficial diversity

### Limitations
- **Feature scope**: Only 6 audio features, missing genre/mood context
- **User modeling**: Simple averaging may not capture preference diversity
- **Cold start**: Requires seed tracks, no handling for new users
- **Popularity bias**: No consideration of track popularity or recency

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Technical Improvements
1. **Feature expansion**: Include genre, mood, lyrical themes
2. **Advanced user modeling**: Weighted averages, preference clustering
3. **Hybrid approaches**: Combine content-based with collaborative filtering
