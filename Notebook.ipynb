        "\n",
        "### Executive Summary\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the development of a content-based music recommendation system using Spotify's audio features. We build a transparent, interpretable recommender that suggests tracks based on musical similarity rather than collaborative filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology Overview\n",
        "Our approach follows a classical content-based recommendation pipeline:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Exploration**: Load and inspect the Spotify tracks dataset\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering**: Select and standardize audio features for modeling  \n",
        "3. **User Preference Modeling**: Create taste vectors from user's seed tracks\n",
        "4. **Similarity Computation**: Use cosine similarity in standardized feature space\n",
        "5. **Recommendation Generation**: Rank and filter similar tracks\n",
        "6. **Evaluation**: Display results with similarity scores\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Technical Decisions\n",
        "- **Feature Selection**: Focus on 6 core audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, valence, acousticness, loudness)\n",
        "- **Standardization**: Zero-mean, unit-variance scaling for fair feature contribution\n",
        "- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity for orientation-based matching\n",
        "- **User Modeling**: Simple averaging of seed track features\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset\n",
        "- **Source**: `spotify_songs.csv` (32,833 tracks)\n",
        "- **Features**: 23 columns including audio features, metadata, and playlist information\n",
        "- **Scope**: Multiple genres and playlists for diverse recommendations\n"
